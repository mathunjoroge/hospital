Background Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa CRPA can cause healthcare-associated infections associated with poor outcomes
"Unlike other carbapenem-resistant organisms, CRPA is often susceptible to at least one traditional anti-pseudomonal β-lactam antibiotic including cefepime, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam S-CRPA"
"This study aimed to determine if treatment of S-CRPA infections with a novel β-lactamβ-lactamase inhibitor βL βLI as opposed to a traditional antipseudomonal β-lactam which may increase the likelihood of resistance, was associated with improved clinical outcomes"
"Patients receiving either a βL βLI or a traditional antipseudomonal β-lactam for definitive antibiotic therapy, defined as having received at least 3 days of the specified antibiotic between 4-14 days after the culture was obtained, were included"
"A causal diagram was created to a priori to identify potential confounders for inclusion in a multivariate analysis including Elixhauser comorbidity score, specimen source, β-lactam resistance pattern, and whether the patient had a hospital-onset infection culture obtained 3 days after admission Results There were 258 patients with S-CRPA who received definitive treatment with either βL βLI n22 or traditional anti-pseudomonal β-lactams n 236"
"In the univariable analysis, patients who received definitive BLBLI therapy had increased mortality and patients without bacteremia and hospital-onset infection had decreased mortality, but the associations were not statistically significant Figure 2"
Conclusions In patients with S-CRPA we did not observe a significant difference in mortality comparing definitive antibiotic treatments

Background Hand hygiene is the most crucial practice for reducing the transmission of infections in healthcare settings
"Despite substantial data highlighting its importance, healthcare institutions frequently struggle to maintain high hand hygiene compliance rates among healthcare workers HCWs"
"Low HCW hand hygiene compliance can lead to an increase in healthcare-associated infections, longer hospital stays, antimicrobial resistance, and higher healthcare costs"
This highlights the urgent need for innovative interventions focused on improving HCW hand hygiene compliance
Methods We piloted a novel program at Brown University Health BUH that enabled patients and visitors to audit HCW hand hygiene using an online interface
"Patientsvisitors were instructed to scan the QR code with their phones to access the audit form, which included three questions about their location inpatientoutpatient, if HCWs performed hand hygiene yesno, and if they would feel comfortable asking staff to perform hand hygiene yesno"
Responses were recorded securely and anonymously in the online platform and monitored by Infection Control
Results Patients and visitors recorded 98 hand hygiene audits of staff during the program trial 72 from the outpatient clinic and 26 from the inpatient units Table 1
"HCW hand hygiene compliance observed by patientsvisitors was 92 in both inpatient and outpatient settings, resulting in an overall compliance rate of 92 during the pilot program"
Figure 1 shows HCW hand hygiene compliance rates as measured by trained BUH staff in the pilot units and clinic during 2024 in relation to the implementation of this program
"We found that after the start of education and implementation of the patientvisitor hand hygiene auditing program in these units, compliance generally increased and remained above pre-intervention levels"
Conclusions This pilot program demonstrates the feasibility and potential effectiveness of engaging patients and visitors in hand hygiene interventions
The results of this pilot suggest that this novel approach warrants further investigation and broader implementation as part of larger efforts improve HCW hand hygiene compliance and reduce healthcare-associated infections

"Outcomes included identification of colonizing organisms, evidence of microbial transmission, and prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens carried by insects"
"Few studies demonstrated the likely transmission of bacteria via insect vector, though all studies demonstrated robust colonization of insect vectors with pathogenic microbes including multi-drug resistant bacteria"
"Background OPAT has emerged as an effective modality for continued treatment of serious infections outside the hospital, requiring complex care coordination and close monitoring for patient safety"
"Hospital readmissions, emergency department utilization, non-anaphylactic allergic reaction defined as documentation of new allergy to OPAT antibiotic, were evaluated while on OPAT or within 30 days of conclusion"
"Bonejoint infection and bacteremia were most frequent indications for OPAT Figure 2, with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and cefazolin most common antibiotics Figure 3"
"Rates of adverse events over time Figure 4 were notable for high prevalence of nephrotoxicity affecting 2075 40 of all episodes, and demonstrating significant association with vancomycin therapy, although no difference was observed between vancomycin monotherapy and vancomycin-containing combination regimens Table 1"
Background Rapid identification of patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales CRE on admission to an acute care hospital is critical to prompt initiation of infection control measures
"Method From 62024  122024 we used an automated daily EMR report to calculate a CRE risk score probability of a CRE clinical culture within 3 days of hospitalization for all admissions from the previous day at two hospitals in an academic healthcare network in Atlanta, GA"
We used MALDI-TOF andor the Vitek2 GN74 panel for species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing
"5 were positive for CRE 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 2 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 Pantoea species"
"04, more healthcare exposures, a higher Elixhauser score, and more antibiotic days of therapy Figure 2"
Conclusion Utilizing an EMR-based risk prediction tool can help identify patients at high-risk for CRE colonization
"In healthcare facilities with a low CRE-prevalence, identifying a high-risk subset of patients, even with an 8 probability of CRE, could be a clinically meaningful infection prevention measure"
"As a part of Multi-site Gram Negative Surveillance Initiative MuGSI, surveillance of Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase ESBL-producing Enterobacterales was conducted in four Tennessee counties Maury, Marshall, Wayne, and Lewis"
This study examines the association between social vulnerability and infection rates for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales within the surveillance area
Method ESBL incident cases reported from July 2019 to December 2023 were analyzed
"Cases were defined as the first isolation of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Klebsiella oxytoca resistant to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin ceftazidime, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and non-resistant to all carbapenem antibiotics from urine or normally sterile sites in residents of the surveillance area within a 30-day period"
"Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between SVI scores and ESBL infection rates per 1,000 residents at the census tract level, as well as the four SVI ranking variables socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial  ethnic minority status, and housing type  transportation"
"7 produced a bivariate choropleth map, illustrating the interaction between SVI and ESBL infection rates"
The analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between SVI and tract-level ESBL infection rates
"Higher vulnerability scores are associated with higher infection rates, as evidenced by the positive correlation coefficient 8477"
Pearson correlation analysis revealed that household type and transportation demonstrated statistically significant positive correlation with ESBL infection rates 8477
ConclusionInformation from geocoding surveillance data can be used to identify social groups at increased risk of infections with drug resistant pathogens
"In this study, ESBL infection rate is significantly associated with SVI"
"Among the four themes, only household type  transportation status is found to be significantly associated with ESBL infection rates"
"Further research is needed to understand the role housing plays in the spread of ESBL infection, especially looking at both urban and rural populations"
"Using SVI scores as a risk assessment tool, infection preventionists and antibiotic stewards can prioritize high risk areas for intervention"
"However, hemodialysis patients, requiring vascular access, have an increased risk of bloodstream infections BSIs"
Gaps in infection prevention and control IPC practices further increase this risk
Philadelphia outpatient hemodialysis facilities with elevated BSI rates were prioritized for Infection Control Assessment and Response visits ICARs
"16, however, high facility catheter utilization rates were not associated with higher BSI rates p0"
"Frequently identified IPC gaps included glove changes without hand hygiene, medication preparation in patient care areas, inadequate catheter hub scrub and dry times, and inconsistent station disinfection practices"

"Next steps are to increase cDHP use as supplemental room disinfection, regardless of anticipated length of stay and investigate potential risks associated with silent CA acquisition identified post discharge"
Background Intact skin is a major barrier for colonization and infections
Burn-related Infections particularly central line associated bacteremia and pneumonia are the most frequent cause of death in burn patients
We aimed at prospectively studying colonization and infections in inpatient burn victims
"All the patients had nasal MRSA swab as well as inguinal swab for MRSA, VRE, C diff, ESBL and CRO screening"
"Additionally, fungal cultures were placed on selective fungal media and incubated for 7 days at 32C"
"Electronic health records were reviewed for antibiotics used local or systemic, hospital associated infections HAI and clinical and surveillance cultures"
MRSA was the most common MDRO identified in clinical and surveillance routine and study cultures
Groin MRSA was slightly more likely to be positive than nasal MRSA 32 vs
C diff was positive in 5 cultures and fungal cultures were positive in 4 patients 3 candida and one Aspergillus
"Other MRDO including CRO, ESBL and VRE were rare only 2 VRE cultures and no CRO"
Local antibiotics were used in the first 10 days in 25 of cases and 35 of the cases after 10 days
HAI was diagnosed in 35 patients with pneumonia then urinary tract infections as the most common ones
Burn registry definition of infection included less than half of the patients reported by the National Health Safety Network NHSN
Strict infection prevention measures and antibiotics stewardship are likely the reason for low infection rate and antibiotic use
Background Tracking and reporting antibiotic use AU are core elements of hospital antibiotic stewardship
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and Childrens Hospital Colorado generated two automated reports of hospital AU to support antibiotic stewardship programs ASPs across Colorado
"Distributed twice per year, it included hospital rates of AU for high-volume and broad-spectrum antibiotics compared to rates from facilities of similar type, bed size, and geographic region Figure"
"The second report pathway adherence summarized adherence to treatment guidelines for adult and pediatric community acquired pneumonia CAP, adult urinary tract infections UTI, and adult skin soft tissue infections SSTI"
"Many facilities responded that they shared the AU feedback reports with hospital leadership, pharmacists, prescribers, infection preventionists, nurses and laboratory personnel, in addition to ASPs and steering committees"

"Enterococcus was recovered from a previous culture in 20 cases 27, with 9 12 being VRE"
"faecium isolates, 59 were vancomycin-resistant, and 48 of those patients had prior vancomycin exposure within the preceding 90 days"
"Approximately 40 of isolates were susceptible to vancomycin; therefore, clinicians need to be alert to the possibility of daptomycin resistance in vancomycin-susceptible E"
"Further study, including case-control analyses, to identify specific risk factors and clarify the role of prior antibiotics vs transmission in the healthcare setting is needed"
Background Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA bacteremia is a reportable hospital -acquired condition that can cause significant harm to hospitalized patients
"Our facility, a 629 bed acute tertiary care hospital, continued to observe Healthcare Facility-Onset HO MRSA bacteremia rates above the corporate goal despite our housewide MRSA decolonization protocol consisting of daily chlorhexidine gluconate bathing CHG and an alcohol nasal antiseptic twice per day for all adult inpatients  18 years of age"
This prompted us to conduct a gap analysis and evidence-based practice review to address our current MRSA decolonization practices
"Methods In January 2024, a revised MRSA decolonization protocol was implemented for our adult inpatient population consisting of the addition of nasal mupirocin twice per day for 5 days for all Intensive Care Unit ICU patients, MRSA nasal screening for high-risk patients, and implementation of contact precautions gown, gloves for patients identified or known with MRSA colonization andor infection"
"Multidisciplinary education on the protocol changes MRSA screening, isolation, and discontinuation of the nasal antiseptic were disseminated to nursing, pharmacy, and the medical staff"
Pre-intervention February 2023 - January 2024 and Post-intervention February 2024-October 2024 time periods were used to assess the impact on the rate of HO MRSA bacteremia and were obtained from The National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN standardized infection ratio SIR 2015 baseline with analysis using the NHSN statistics calculator
"Results Following implementation of the decolonization protocol, the MRSA bacteremia cumulative SIR decreased 91 from 1"
The ICU MRSA bacteremia rate also showed statistical significance with a decrease from 4
Conclusion Revising the MRSA decolonization protocol significantly decreased our MRSA bacteremia rates
"This included re-implementation of contact precautions, screening high-risk patients that could be carriers of MRSA, and mupirocin decolonization for ICU patients"
"Facilities should consider evaluation of their MRSA decolonization, isolation, and screening practices if unable to decrease their HO MRSA bacteremia rates"

Bloodstream infections BSI caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae increased at our institution in 2021-2022
Methods The rates of ESBL-producing Klebsiella BSI per 1000 hospitalizations in 2021 and 2022 in transplant recipients and non-transplant patients were compared
"From 112021 to 06302023, 49 adult patients at an academic medical center had Klebsiella pneumoniae BSI with ceftriaxone resistance and a high probability of carrying an ESBL"
"BugSeq bioinformatics pipeline and refMLST were utilized on the sequenced isolates to assess clonality, defined as 20 allele difference between two isolates"
Results The rate of ESBL-producing Klebsiella BSI increased universally from 2021 to 2022 but impacted the transplant cohort 0
"The most common ESBL gene identified was blaCTX-M-15, identified in 24 isolates 86"
Conclusions There was a sharp increase in the number of BSI caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in the transplant population between 2021 and 2022
A molecular epidemiologic analysis ruled out clonal transmission from breakdown of infection prevention practices as the cause
This demonstrates the application of whole-genome sequencing in excluding a clonal outbreak from a common source within an institution
Background Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant pathogen that presents significant infection control challenges due to its ability to cause invasive infections and outbreaks
"Despite its increasing prevalence in healthcare settings, there is limited guidance or data related to perioperative infection prevention in patients colonized with C"

"Conclusion The survey highlights the lack of institutional guidelines for Candida auris prevention in perioperative settings, including among solid-organ transplant patients"
"auris infections are being encountered, although uncommon, underscoring the need for further research and standardized guidelines to address perioperative prevention of this emerging pathogen"
Background Healthcare facility-onset HO Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA bacteremia represents a critical patient safety issue due to its associated morbidity and mortality
This project sought to identify root causes and implement targeted quality improvement measures to strengthen HO MRSA bacteremia prevention efforts
The template included 58 variables based on local and national MRSA prevention measures and National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN recommendations
Cases meeting NHSN HO MRSA criteria were included in the analysis
Infection preventionists reviewed electronic medical records and documented findings using the RCA template
The RCA findings highlighted gaps in peripheral intravenous line PIV care and maintenance as potential contributors to bloodstream infection risk
9 of which involved blood cultures with no other identified source
Conclusion HO MRSA bacteremia prevention requires a comprehensive approach that prioritizes patient safety while leveraging RCA findings and frontline staff input
"Planned interventions, including re-education on PIV best practices, addressing survey-identified barriers, and implementing a bloodstream infection prevention bundle, are set for implementation in the next calendar year"
These efforts aim to strengthen HO MRSA bacteremia prevention and improve patient outcomes
"Background Patient bathing plays a vital role in patient care and cleanliness, as well as in the prevention of infections, assisting in the removal of transient skin flora, which are predominately gram-positive organisms, particularly Staphylococci"
"Current cleaning and disinfection protocols encourage the disinfection of the shower facilities in between each patient, but adherence to this practice can be a challenge with the staffing shortages seen in environmental services linked to long-term care facilities"
The purpose of this point-prevalence study was to identify Staphylococci contamination in shower facilities at a long-term care and rehabilitation center Methods Five shower room facilities in a long-term care and rehabilitation center were cultured on one day in July 2024
"Five surfaces in the shower facilityroom were cultured the shower bench, the faucet, the floor drain, the grab bar, and the shower curtain"
"A total of 25 cultures were obtained using sterile transport swabs with liquid Stuarts medium Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA and immediately placed in ice for transport to a microbiology lab"
"At the lab, the swabs were plated onto two different agars CHROM MRSA agar and mannitol salt agar MSA and incubated for 48 hours"
"Results Of the five surfaces cultured in the shower facilities, the bench shower seats were the most heavily contaminated"
"All of the bench shower seats tested positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus CoNS and Staphylococcus aureus MSSA, and 40 of the bench seats tested positive for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA"
"The floor drains were the second most contaminated surfaces, with 80 of surfaces testing positive for both CoNS and MRSA, respectively"
"Finding 40 of shower benches contaminated with MRSA is concerning, particularly for some of the elderly patients using these showers"

Background Healthcare-associated infections HAI and multi-drug resistant organisms MDRO are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the hospital setting
Bacteria often colonize a patients skin and can become a source of infection
"Bathing patients with chlorhexidine CHG has been shown to decrease colonization with MDROs, central-line associated bloodstream infection CLABSI, and HAIs"
"Prior to October 2023, all patients on the unit received a daily CHG bath with 4 CHG solution, which was the standard of care in the rest of the hospital"
Patients would then receive a daily CHG bath with a 4 CHG solution
"If a patient were to refuse a bath with the 4 CHG solution, they would be offered a bath with the 2 CHG wipes"
"83 per 1000 patient days, 2 MRSA bloodstream infections, and 3 VRE bloodstream infections"
"07 per 1000 patient days, no MRSA bloodstream infections, and no VRE bloodstream infections"

Carefully designed MDRO policies can enhance patient care without compromising infection prevention goals
Background In June of 2024 the Cincinnati Health Department Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Unit investigated an outbreak of Carbapenemase-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa CRPA Verona Integron-encoded Metallo-beta-lactamase VIM infections at a local hospital after whole genomic sequencing WGS performed by the Centers for Disease Control CDC determined two patients had closely related infections
At the time CDC was using WGS to link CRPA infections to the multi-state outbreak associated with artificial tears
"CDCs WGS technology enables faster detection of healthcare-associated infection outbreaks by determining how closely the organisms are related genetically, which facilitates a faster public health response"
The facility was provided with cleaning and disinfection guidance and transmission based precaution guidance specific to CRPA
5 who were hospitalized at the same facility between March and September of 2024 were determined to have closely related CRPA VIM infections through WGS
Their infections were not closely related to the artificial tears-associated outbreak
"There were procedural, staff, and potential equipment overlaps found between cases 1 and 2 including Ultrasound-guided ART line and midline performed on consecutive days, and EchoTTE performed on the same day by the same provider"
Conclusion The detection of two closely related CRPA VIM cases in a hospital through WGS allowed public health responders to quickly identify an outbreak and work closely with the facility in order to implement organism specific infection control measures that helped contain the spread of an insidious healthcare-associated infection to a total of four cases over six months
The outbreak was determined to be over when no new infections were detected for a period of four weeks
"Results Sink samples were obtained 11 times from July 2024 to October 2024 giving 990 total cultures, 495 in each study arm"

Background Neonatal intensive care units NICU are associate with a high level of antibiotic consumption
Appropriate antibiotic use is crucial to minimize the emergence of resistance and unintended consequences to the patient
"Our antimicrobial stewardship program ASP performed a baseline review of NICU antibiotic prescribing, which revealed excessive meropenem use and inconsistent empiric antibiotic prescribing practices within the unit"
Third generation cephalosporins were vastly underutilized due to concerns of increased Candida infections resulting in the unwarranted excessive use of meropenem
"1 Methods In 2023, the ASP created an institution specific empiric NICU sepsis guideline to align empiric prescribing practices with current guidelines and reduce the unwarranted use of carbapenems"
"The primary objectives were to evaluate the effect of the guideline implementation on antibiotic days of therapy DOT per 1000 patient-days, overall meropenem and third generation cephalosporin utilization, differences in the incidence of Candida infections, and variations in antimicrobial sensitivity"
Microbiologic data from sterile site cultures were obtained April 2021 to March 2023 and post-implementation April 2023 to March 2024 to evaluate cephalosporin and meropenem resistance for each period
"There were no observed differences in the incidence of Candida infections, cephalosporin resistance in Gram-negative bacilli, or the organisms isolated over the observation period"
Conclusions Guideline implementation safely and successfully reduced the use of carbapenems by providing alternative antibiotic regimens encouraging the use of third generation cephalosporins and reduced antibiotic pressure in our NICU
"There were no differences in the incidence of Candida infections, organisms, or resistance patterns"
Implementation of this guideline resulted in safe decreases in antibiotic use in the NICU

Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship for Health Departments includes tracking and reporting of antibiotic use AU
"Methods DHS contracted with the Wisconsin Health Information Organizations to access their database to review all payers claims data from 20182023, which included medical encounter and pharmaceutical claims"
"Antibiotic visits were defined as an outpatient visit associated with a filled oral, systemic antibiotic prescription ordered up to three days after the encounter"
"Antibiotic visits were normalized by all outpatient visits as a rate per 1,000 visits"
"A quality measure of antibiotic visits for respiratory tract infection RTI was developed using the CDCs tier 3 ICD-10 codes representing cough, upper RTI, or bronchitis without co-occurring ICD-10 code for other infection"
"Antibiotic visit rates were then summarized at the health care organization level, with additional stratification by place of service, diagnosis, patient age, and provider type"
Statewide benchmarks were developed for all diagnoses and RTI antibiotic visit rates Tables 1 and 2
Visits by surgeons and advanced practitioners had the highest rates of antibiotic prescribing for tier 3 RTIs; rates were similar across places of service

Objectives To characterize the incidence and contributing factors related to hospital-onset bloodstream infection HOBsi in a nine hospital healthcare system
Background Bloodstream infections that develop during hospitalization are critical measures of healthcare quality
Though these events are measured in part through CMS reports of central line-associated bloodstream infections CLABSIs and MRSA bloodstream infections
A newer metric has been introduced by National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN to measure any case of bloodstream infection with onset on or after hospital day four
"Methods Positive blood cultures obtained on or after hospital day four from nine hospitals across northeast and central Pennsylvania were included in this study, spanning July 2021 to June 2024"
"Cases were classified based on NHSN criteria primary bloodstream infections BSIs, CLABSIs, mucosal barrier injury-related infections, and secondary bacteremia with identified sources e"
", pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infection or surgical site infection"
"1 infections per 10,000 patient days, followed by critical care units at 11"
"When NHSN-defined source was found secondary BSIs, pneumonia was the most common source 6"
Conclusion This quality measure significantly expands the scope of infection events over CLABSI
Background Clostridioides difficile infections CDI are a leading cause of health-care associated morbidity and costs
"To improve our infection prevention and control measures, we sought to study these HO CDI cases"
"Methods Using a retrospective cohort study design and electronic health records, we retrieved data for inpatients who were identified as having HO CDI by our department of infection prevention and control in 2024"
"Results In 2024 there were 20 HO CDI cases versus 9 in 2023 with consequent increase in the CDI rate per 10,000 patient days and the standardized infection ratio"
All had received systemic antibiotics either singly or in combination and the most commonly used agents included cephalosporins 90 and penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitor 35
"Most cases 70 were treated with oral vancomycin with three cases receiving a taperprophylaxis, while five cases received fidaxomicin; there was one case of recurrence"
This project evaluates factors involved with health disparities in patients with identified hospital-associated infections HAIs
"This data set included Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, Clostridioides difficile infection CDI, and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci VRE infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections CAUTI, central line associated bloodstream infections CLABSI, and surgical site infections SSI from 29 procedures"
"Data was stratified with equity, inclusion, and diversity risk factors, and employing multivariate regression analysis to calculate odds ratios for infection"
"Ventilator-associated events VAEs, including ventilator-associated pneumonia VAP, are important among hospitalized patients due to their high morbidity, mortality, and associated costs"
"These infections are frequently caused by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter, which are known for their antibiotic resistance"
"However, because these are in direct contact with the air supplied to patients, they can become sources of infection and reservoirs for antimicrobial-resistant organisms"
Swabs from heater wire prongs were cultured and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technology
Bacterial DNA was detected on all clean probes and bacterial growth found on 42 of clean probe cultures
"Additionally, all of the clean probe cultures were positive for Stenotrophomonas, another well known multi-drug resistant pathogen"
"After the autoclaving protocol was implemented, no bacterial growth was observed cultures 72 hours of freshly sterilized probes"
"This improved sterilization protocol is expected to reduce the risk of infection transmission and the incidence of VAEs, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes"
Background A Quality Improvement QI initiative to reduce invasive Staphylococcus aureus SA infections in a level IV neonatal intensive care unit NICU successfully eliminated Methicillin-resistant MRSA but not Methicillin-susceptible MSSA infections
A combination of SA whole genome sequencing WGS and environmental culturing helped to better understand the epidemiology of MSSA colonization and infection in the NICU and drive new infection prevention interventions
"Statistical analyses examined correlations between monthly effective cleaning, hand hygiene compliance, and colonization rates"
"To better understand MSSA spread in the NICU, WGS was performed on a convenience sample of 42 MSSA isolates, sampled one month before and after an invasive MSSA infection"
Statistical analyses showed no significant correlation between environmental cleaning or hand hygiene compliance and colonization rates
Conclusions Persistent MSSA colonization and invasive infections in the NICU result from both within-unit transmission and the introduction of unique isolates
"These findings are being used to inform the development of new interventions, including updated below-the-elbow hand hygiene protocols, revised environmental cleaning plans, nurse-parent communication training, and a virtual reality hand hygiene training program for parents and staff"
WGS of pathogenic organisms is a useful tool to drive QI initiatives aimed at reducing hospital-acquired infections
Background Isolation and cohorting are essential components of an effective infection prevention and control IPC program within healthcare settings to prevent spreading infectious diseases
Compliance with isolation precautions was categorized into good and poor groups based on the mean response score
7 who participated in infection control training demonstrated a high level of compliance with isolation
"In terms of good compliance with isolation precautions, physicians and nurses had higher odds OR 11"
Such initiatives are essential to help limit the spread of infections in healthcare settings
"Background Wastewater-based epidemiology has demonstrated effectiveness in monitoring trends of viral infections at the city, state, and national levels"
"Traditional healthcare-associated infection surveillance relies on case-based approaches, which can be resource-intensive, prone to misclassification, and may miss patients who are colonized"
We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing wastewater-based epidemiology in an acute care hospital for monitoring pathogens relevant to infection prevention and control
We compared hospital wastewater nucleic acid concentrations with the number of positive testscultures at Stanford Hospital during the same period and with Wastewaterscan community wastewater data
"However, trends for antimicrobial resistance genes may be influenced by additional factors, such as the number of colonized patients, bacterial load in the hospital sewage system, hospital antimicrobial use, and antibiotic residues in wastewater"
Background State-level hospital comparative antibiotic usage rates can highlight opportunities for interventions to optimize antimicrobial stewardship AS
We sought to characterize antibiotic usage rates for Nebraska hospitals stratified by hospital size and rurality
Methods NHSN antibiotic use AU data reported from September 2023 to August 2024 was extracted
Hospitals reporting adult data for any antibiotics of interest were included in analysis
"Rurality was defined using the USDA rural urban commuting area codes urban 1-3, semi-urban 4-6, and rural 7-10"
Pooled AU rates were used to provide a state rate by covariates and antibiotics
"The top 5 antibiotics used were cefazolin, ceftriaxone, piperacillintazobactam, vancomycin, and cefepime Figure 1"
"Although, there were no significant variations in total AU based on hospital size and rurality, some significant differences were noted when broken down by specific antibiotics Figures 2 and 3"
No significant difference was noted in the use of any antibiotics when comparing semiurban to urban and medium to large size hospitals
Conclusions Significant variation exists in use of some antibiotics based on the hospital size and rurality

Background Calls within the clinical community for revising guidance on the appropriate durations of antibiotic therapy i
"To inform efforts to effectively communicate evolving evidence on appropriate antibiotic use, we examined US adults perceptions and preferences regarding antibiotic durations and adherence"
"Methods From March to April 2024, we invited US adults, aged 18 years, to an online survey about antibiotics"
"Question topics included durations of antibiotic therapy, adherence to a prescribed course of antibiotics, and demographic characteristics"
Most respondents reported they preferred to take a longer course of antibiotics 7 days than a shorter one 3-5 days for a bacterial respiratory infection 60
"4 of respondents agreed that it is important to always finish a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better and had either been told this by a medical professional 76"
5 said they had ever been told they could stop taking antibiotics early
"Preference for longer antibiotic courses was associated with older age, trusting their doctors advice about antibiotic therapy durations, having been told by their doctor to always finish a course of antibiotics, less worry about antibiotic side effects, discomfort about potentially being asked by a clinician to stop taking antibiotics when they start to feel better, and perceiving the clinician suggesting that as less competent"
Conclusions Many US adults prefer longer durations of antibiotic therapy for respiratory infections than are likely necessary
These findings highlight the need for evidence-based communication strategies for aligning US adults antibiotic duration and adherence preferences with current guidance

ABSTRACTTheories explaining the evolution of plant defensive strategies are difficult to experimentally test
Biological invasion scenarios can serve as helpful natural experiments for examining the evolutionary dynamics of plant defenses when plants become established as potential hosts in new environments
We document a shift in herbivore preference patterns for constitutive versus herbivoreinduced tissues when comparing plants from native and invaded ranges
"However, specific biochemical defenses showed a conserved negative correlation between constitutive and inducible defenses across both ranges, indicating a fundamental tradeoff in defense strategy that persists despite allocation differences, suggesting defense evolution that was not revealed by tests in this study"
"These results provide evidence of evolutionary shifts in plant palatability that are consistent with predictions of the SDH, which predicts evolutionary shifts in defense allocation"
Our findings reveal complex evolutionary dynamics that underlie invasion success and demonstrate that invasive M
"polymorpha have undergone evolutionary adaptation in defense strategy beyond any immediate ecological advantages of enemy release, providing insight into how invasive plants successfully adapt to novel herbivore communities over time"
"Furthermore, it provides a foundation for the analysis of the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the evolution of gut microbial communities"

ESBL-E and CRE colonies were additionally plated onto MacConkey agar and only lactose fermenting organisms were considered positive
New MDRO acquisition was defined as a negative index MDRO culture with a subsequent positive culture
"Nearly half of this cohort acquired CRE following admission, highlighting the need for strict infection prevention and control measures and tailored empiric antibiotic strategies"
"Background Candida auris and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA are prevalent in nursing homes, and both are known to shed profusely from the skin"
"auris, some of whom also carried MRSA, were evaluated for proximal shed around their bed during rest and caregiving activities using chromogenic settle plates"
"auris and MRSA culture, along with an axillagroin swab for measuring chlorhexidine concentration CHG used for routine bathing"
"auris and MRSA shedding increased significantly during caregiving activities, supporting CDCs current recommendations for enhanced barrier precautions in nursing homes, which involve gown and glove use during high-contact care for carriers of multidrug-resistant organisms"
Background The continued rise of antimicrobial resistance AMR and reduction of pharmacological options has created an urgent need for new countermeasures to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms MDROs 1
"auris point-prevalence testing was performed during the 16-month observation period according to health department protocols and HAIs were evaluated by the same infection preventionist and defined by NHSN standards for catheter associated urinary tract infections CAUTIs, central line associated bloodstream infections CLABSIs, Clostridioides difficile CDIFF, and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA 4"

Infection control practices designed to prevent disease transmission contribute to this substantial carbon footprint
We explored environmental cleaning practices and the energy use associated with ultraviolent UV light disinfection
Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on the energy consumption of three different UV light disinfection machines used at Stanford Health Care from September 2023 to August 2024
"Results We found that UV light disinfection utilized approximately 7,300 kWh constituting less than 1 of Stanford Health Care total energy use for the period"
"Recent data suggests that there may be no additional benefit to UV light disinfection when other enhanced cleaning methods, such as sporicidal cleaners, are utilized"
Infection prevention practices often incorporate redundancies given the dependence on human behavior and the high consequences of practice failures
"In the future, a life cycle analysis could be conducted to compare UV light disinfection and sporicidal cleaning methods to evaluate each practices impact on sustainability efforts"
Our evaluation showed that UV light disinfection results in modest energy usage reductions
Future evaluation will analyze its impact on antimicrobial utilization and infection control metrics

Background Universal decolonization using chlorhexidine gluconate CHG foaming soap in a hospital system has been shown to reduce healthcare-associated infections HAIs and colonization by multidrug-resistant organisms
This study evaluates the effect of increasing CHG compliance on MRSA HAI rates
"We performed root cause analyses to identify factors contributing to poor compliance, and then initiated a bundled intervention, including nursing staff education on the benefits of CHG bathing to reduce HAIs, how to reframe discussions with patients about refusals, removal of one alternative soap product from the inventory, and moving the CHG bathing product in clean supply rooms to be in proximity with other patient hygiene products for easier access"
We evaluated the utilization of CHG bathing products through inventory data on utilization of 4 fluid ounce bottles of 4
"0 weightvolume CHG solution, documentation of at least one CHG bath in the electronic medical record EMR per unique hospitalization, and HAI rates per National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN definitions for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA, before 082023-022024 and after 032024-122024 implementation of the bundle"
"After bundled interventions, inventory usage CHG bottles increased from 170 to 270 bottles per 1,000 bed days of care BDOC p Conclusion An intervention of staff education, removal of an alternative soap product, and improving access to CHG bathing products in supply rooms, resulted in improved CHG bathing adherence, and was associated with a reduction in MRSA HAIs in an acute care VA hospital"

"Background Antimicrobial resistance AMR is a pressing global public health issue, and the limited development of new antibiotics necessitates robust Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs ASP"
"Phase 3 2025 Antimicrobial preauthorization, infection-based interventions, and antimicrobial timeouts within 4872 hours of initiation"
"Results By 2023, all countries have established ASP committees and adopted guidelines for infections and surgical prophylaxis see Table 2"
Education Comprehensive initiatives included patient education on completing antibiotic regimens and continuous education for healthcare professionals
A framework for tracking key resistance organisms and hospital-acquired infections was also established
"Therapy optimization Policies required prescribers to document antibiotic doses and indications, while IV-to-oral conversion protocols reduced costs and improved outcomes"
"Metrics like Days of Therapy and Defined Daily Doses measured impact, with dose optimization improving treatment for resistant organisms"
"By utilizing a phased approach, we have ensured consistent and effective implementation across diverse healthcare settings"
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA poses a significant global health threat that requires novel antimicrobials to combat this WHO-designated priority pathogen
"In this study, we designed, synthesized and evaluated a series of unexplored trisindoline derivatives against MRSA, including multidrug-resistant MDR clinical isolates"
The Structure Activity Relationship SAR analysis of the trisindolines indicated the importance of strategic substitutions in the trisindoline core for their anti-staphylococcal efficacy
"Furthermore, the derivatives displayed rapid bactericidal action, anti-biofilm efficacy, intracellular MRSA killing and combinatorial effect with vancomycin"
Mechanistic studies revealed that these compounds disrupt MRSA cell integrity by influencing several membrane-related pathways
"Finally, in vivo assessments of a lead trisindoline in an MRSA-induced systemic infection model demonstrated a significant reduction of bacterial load"
"Therefore, these trisindoline molecules may offer a promising therapeutic model for combating MRSA infections"
"Background The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Safety Program for MRSA Prevention Surgical Services cohort aimed to reduce surgical site infections SSIs and prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA in teams performing surgeries at high risk for infection with and high morbidity due to MRSA cardiac, knee or hip replacement, and spinal fusion using evidence-based infection prevention interventions and the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program CUSP framework"
Methods The Surgical Services Safety Program for MRSA Prevention was implemented from January 2023 to June 2024
"The aim was to increase teamwork and collaboration, reinforce safety culture, implement evidence-based infection prevention practices, and decrease SSIs and MRSA"
"Teams submitted baseline and endline information on patient safety culture and on infrastructure at the team- and hospital-level, as well as monthly data regarding process measures and SSIs"
"Significant improvements in team-based process measures of surgical team infrastructure Figure 1 and in teams reporting that patients received evidence-based practices Figure 2 were observed across several areas from baseline to endline, including preoperative decolonization, appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, and intraoperative infection prevention procedures"
Conclusions The AHRQ Safety Program for MRSA Prevention supported implementation of evidence-based infection prevention practices to prevent MRSA and SSIs in high-risk surgeries
Background Candida species are increasingly causing infections and are considered high priority fungal pathogens
Our goal is to characterize treatment outcomes of patients who had Candida spp isolated from bile cultures obtained via Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ERCP to determine the value of antifungal use in these cases
Methods We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with bile cultures positive for Candida spp collected during ERCPs from January 2010 to December 2023
Patients were identified by cross-matching databases of patients who underwent ERCP and patients with Candida-positive bile cultures
The treatment cohort included patients who received antifungals within seven days of the first ERCP with Candida growth in bile cultures principal ERCP compared to a control cohort who did not
Patients with candidemia or deep-seated candida infection prior to the principal ERCP or insufficient chart data were excluded
The primary outcome was a composite of death andor development of invasive candida infection within one year of the principal ERCP date
Conclusions This retrospective study of the use of antifungals in patients with Candida growing from bile cultures following ERCP found no benefit in starting antifungal treatment
This underscores an urgent need to design tools to optimize antibiotic prescribing to target these pathogens
"However, facility-level antibiograms are limited to individual institutions and do not reflect regional variations in resistance"
Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility and importance of generating regional antibiograms to better inform regional infection prevention and spearhead antimicrobial stewardship initiatives
"These data were combined to create a single, cumulative antibiogram with 18 clinically relevant combinations of microorganisms and antibiotics"
Results Data from 10 hospitals were combined to create one regional antibiogram with 18 organisms and 21 antibiotics
Data from a regional antibiogram is useful in assessing susceptibilities and can serve as a valuable antimicrobial stewardship tool for institutions without access to their own specific antibiogram
"Additionally, implementation of targeted stewardship policies, such as carbapenem restriction, demonstrates promise to potentially slow the development of resistant pathogens, thereby improving patient outcomes"
Background Infection is a common and highly morbid postoperative complication in victims of physical trauma
"Using informatics and manual chart review, we analyzed patient demographics, rates of infection, sites of infection, timing of infection from initial trauma event, and causative organisms"
"7 of patients developed a culture-positive surgical site infection SSI or intra-abdominal infection IAI, with a rate of 40"
"Conclusions Infection in civilian trauma laparotomy often arises as SSI or IAI, and is most pronounced in the DCL population"
"Further research is required to assess whether yeast burden can be mitigated by either incorporating antifungal prophylaxis at time of initial laparotomy, or by shortening empiric post-laparotomy antibiotic courses"
"Background Antimicrobial resistance AMR poses a critical threat to global health, with healthcare-associated infections HAIs such as Clostridioides difficile and multidrug-resistant organisms MDROs exacerbated by antibiotic misuse"
"Up to 50 of inpatients receive antibiotics during their hospital stay, nearly 13 of which is inappropriate"
"The Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio SAAR at Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center MEDVAMC exceeded 1 from 20232024, signaling higher-than-expected antibiotic use"
"Nurses, as pivotal frontline healthcare providers, are often underutilized in antimicrobial stewardship program ASP efforts due to a lack of formal ASP education"
"Methods This quality improvement project utilized the Plan-Do-Study-Act PDSA framework to develop, implement, and refine an educational intervention aimed at enhancing RN knowledge and engagement in ASP"
Post-intervention surveys and infection rate analyses were conducted to evaluate outcomes
"Improved RN competency in ASP facilitated stronger interdisciplinary communication and adherence to stewardship protocols, such as performing antibiotic time outs"
"Some examples of patient safety practices that improved, included more consistent documentation of allergy checks, antibiotic indications, and treatment plans within the electronic health record"
"Post-intervention, nurses felt more comfortable providing patient education on the importance of completing antibiotics, recognizing side effects, and infection prevention"
Conclusions Empowering nurses through targeted ASP education not only bridges critical knowledge gaps but also fosters a culture of safety and accountability in antibiotic use
"Sustaining these outcomes requires integrating ASP education into routine RN training, continuous monitoring of infection rates, and leveraging interdisciplinary collaboration to maintain compliance with evidence-based stewardship practices"

Facilities with low scores were consecutively profiled for targeted quality improvement
"The peptide hormone adrenomedullin ADM plays a key role in sepsis owing to its potent vasodilatory effects, ability to maintain vascular integrity, and critical role in modulating immune responses and reducing inflammation"
"Here, we present hourly resolved kinetics of ADM activation during early sepsis onset in a porcine model and analyze the AdrenOSS-1 human cohort data to assess biomarker changes in advanced sepsis progression"
"The porcine model data showed that both bio-ADM and ADM-Gly mean concentrations rose within the first two hours post-induction, preceding measurable sepsis onset, with a greater increase in ADM-Gly 260"
AdrenOSS-1 study revealed that ICU sepsis patients had higher ADM-Gly 121
"This study provides novel insights into the dynamics of adrenomedullin ADM homeostasis during sepsis progression, highlighting the critical interplay between its glycine-extended precursor ADM-Gly, fully active form bio-ADM, and the amidating enzyme PAM"
"Elevated ADM-Gly and PAM activity were associated with increased sepsis severity and 28-day mortality, while a higher bio-ADMADM-Gly ratio was linked to improved survival"
"These results underscore the potential of ADM-Gly, bio-ADM, and PAM as biomarkers for sepsis severity and prognosis, and support therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing PAM activity to restore endothelial integrity and improve patient outcomes in sepsis"
"This study identified unique MPXV genomic profiles in NYC, estimated concurrent infections with multiple MPXV strains and emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance and public health strategies to address co-infections, especially through collaboration with labs, clinics, and community groups"

"For instance, central line associated bloodstream infections CLABSIs approximately increase length of stay by 13"
"In 2013, the REDUCE MRSA trial compared universal MRSA decolonization to targeted MRSA decolonization in the ICU and found superiority ini reducing positive MRSA cultures and all cause bloodstream infections"
We aim to decrease central line associated bloodstream infections at our institution by adopting the REDUCE MRSA trial protocol
Methods and Outcomes All patients admitted to the medicalsurgical ICU and cardiac ICU at St Francis Hospital starting in December of 2023 received daily intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine bathing regardless of their MRSA status
The secondary outcomes were the standard infection ratio and CLABSI per central line day
We used unpaired t testing to assess the CLABSI rate per month and used a negative binomial regression model to calculate the standard infection ratio according to the NHSN 2015 national baseline
Results and Discussion We had a total of 6 CLABSIs in the ICU this year after initiating universal MRSA decolonization
Conclusions Our results suggest that universal MRSA decolonization in the ICU may decrease the number of CLABSIs
We recommend further research to assess for potential benefits of universal MRSA decolonization in other areas of the hospital where MRSA infection rates are high like step down units
Background Lower respiratory tract infections LRTI are a leading cause of pediatric mortality
"Treatment typically involves empirical antibiotics, followed by de-escalation based on cultures, which are often negative"
"The BioFire Pneumonia PCR panel detects pathogens rapidly, allowing for potentially faster optimization of antimicrobial therapy"
We hypothesized that patients with LRTI evaluated using the BAL PCR panel PCR cohort had shorter times to results and targeted therapy compared to those with BAL cultures alone control cohort
"The PCR cohort included patients from August 1, 2021, to November 1, 2023, who underwent both BAL culture and PCR testing"
"The control cohort included patients from August 1, 2017, to November 1, 2019, who had BAL cultures alone"
"The primary outcome was time to targeted therapy, defined as the time from culture collection to escalation or de-escalation"
"Discordant results between PCR and culture were 57, with 81 due to additional bacteria detected by PCR"
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the most common organism detected by culture but not included in the PCR panel
Time to targeted therapy was significantly shorter in the PCR group compared to culture group 0 vs
"Rates of escalation, prior antibiotic use, and adverse outcomes were similar"
Conclusion The BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel provides faster results and may aid in optimizing therapy in pediatric patients with LRTI

"Here, we expand upon this finding by demonstrating that HCMV infection increases the abundance of PCs in several different fibroblasts and, similarly, in endothelial and epithelial cells"
We demonstrate that HCMV infection promotes the activity in the de novo PC synthesis pathway using a 13C-choline isotopic tracer and liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry
Infection did not alter the activity in the other two pathways
"Moreover, we examined the kinetics of PC remodeling by HCMV and found that PC synthesis was promoted and the PC lipidome shifted after 24 h post-infection"
"Overall, this work suggests that the early steps of HCMV replication promote the reprogramming of host lipid metabolism to ensure the synthesis of a lipidome necessary to support HCMV infection"
IMPORTANCEHuman cytomegalovirus HCMV is a common herpesvirus that establishes a lifelong and persistent infection in its human host
"We demonstrate that the activity in the other PC synthesis pathways, the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase and Lands cycles, is unaltered by HCMV infection"

Antibiotic tolerance corresponds to the bacterial ability to survive a transient exposure to antibiotics and is often associated with treatment failure
This study explores the use of a growth-independent method utilizing nanomotion technology to detect antibiotic-tolerant bacteria
The nanomotion signal obtained from a nanomechanical sensor measures real-time metabolic activity and cellular processes and could provide valuable information about the tolerance of bacteria to antibiotics that cannot be detected by standard antibiotic susceptibility tests
The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of nanomotion technology to record antibiotic-tolerant bacteria
"Similarly, when exponentially growing cells were exposed to ampicillin, an antibiotic whose efficacy depends on the growth rate, the nanomotion signal also decreased"
"In addition, antibiotic exposure can cause bacterial elongation, in which the biomass of a cell increases without cell division"
This work shows that nanomotion signals entail information about the reaction to antibiotics that standard MIC-based antibiotic susceptibility tests cannot detect
"In the future, nanomotion-based antibiotic tolerance tests could be developed for clinical use in chronic or relapsing infections"

"Mycobacterium abscessus MABS is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause severe lung infections, particularly in individuals with cystic fibrosis"
"Despite the clinical significance of these morphotypes, the relationship between GPL levels, morphotype and the pathogenesis of MABS infections remains poorly understood"
The mechanisms and implications of GPL production and morphotypes in clinical MABS infections are unclear
A high-content ex vivo infection model using THP-1 cells assessed the infectivity of both clinical and laboratory strains
"Across morphotype groups, no differences were observed in vitro, yet clinical R strains were observed to replicate at higher levels in the THP-1 infection model"
"Moreover, the proportion of infected macrophages was notably higher among clinical R strains compared to their S counterparts at 72 h post-infection"
"Clinical variants also infected THP-1 cells at significantly higher rates compared to laboratory strains, highlighting the limited translatability of lab strain infection data to clinical contexts"
"Our study confirmed the general correlation between morphotype and GPL levels in smooth strains yet unveiled more variability within morphotype groups than previously recognized, particularly during intracellular infection"

"Serological assays, which measure a range of biomarkers relating to humoral immunity, can provide a valuable window into immune responses generated by past infections and vaccinations"
"However, traditional methods for interpreting serological data, such as binary seropositivity and seroconversion thresholds, often rely on heuristics that fail to account for individual variability in antibody kinetics and timing of infection, potentially leading to biased estimates of infection rates and post-exposure immune responses"
"To address these limitations, we developed serojump, a novel probabilistic framework and software package that uses individual-level serological data to infer infection status, timing, and subsequent antibody kinetics"
"In simulation studies, the model accurately recovered individual infection status, population-level antibody kinetics, and the relationship between biomarkers and immunity against infection, demonstrating robustness under observational noise"
"Benchmarking against standard serological heuristics in real-world data revealed that serojump achieves higher sensitivity in identifying infections, outperforming static threshold-based methods and precision in inferred infection timing"
Application of serojump to longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serological data taken during the Delta wave provided additional insights into i missed infections based on sub-threshold rises in antibody level and ii antibody responses to multiple biomarkers post-vaccination and infection

One of the main factors of antimicrobial resistance is non-compliance with infection control measures
Contact alert markers must be installed in the patient area to remind officers to carry out infection transmission prevention to prevent the failure of infection control practices
The provision of red markers and information on the infection suffered by patients creates a stigma that is less accepted because of patient privacy
"This study aimed to evaluate the modified marker with a batik design as local wisdom without infection information, as a reminder of infection control practices by officers, and to maintain patient privacy"
Method The Committee for Infection Prevention and Control modified the design of markers of patients with antimicrobial resistance
Batik markers were designed with hand hygiene reminders and batik motifs as local wisdom so as not to cause negative stigma
Batik markers were implemented in the patients bed area so that it was easy for officers to understand how to implement infection control practices and supervise patients with antimicrobial resistance
Adherence to Hand Hygiene increased by up to 4 in one month
"With the Batik Marker, officers could easily recognize the marker so that infection control practices could be carried out according to hospital regulations"
"Implementing Batik Markers at inpatient areas with antimicrobial resistance makes it easier for staff to implement increased contact awareness, supervision recording, and improved hand hygiene without causing rejection from the patients family"

Tick-borne spotted fever group Rickettsia SFGR poses a significant threat to public health worldwide
"To explore the impact of tick-cofeeding hedgehogs on the natural transmission of SFGR, to clarify the underlying hypotheses, and to provide robust data to support targeted prevention and control strategies for spotted fever, this study developed a transmission model using tick-cofeeding hedgehogs that simulates the natural transmission process"
"61 acquired Rickettsia after engorgement, but this infection rate dropped sharply to 9"
"In contrast, formerly uninfected adults that cofed on hedgehogs showed a 100 infection rate after engorgement"
"However, the infection rates declined significantly in their offspring, with only 11"
"Our results demonstrate that while tick-cofeeding on hedgehogs can lead to a high positive rate of Rickettsia in ticks, the infections acquired through cofeeding fail to sustain this high positivity rate due to several mechanisms"
"Firstly, rickettsiae obtained through cofeeding or blood meals do not consistently establish infections in all recipient ticks, resulting in a significant decline in positive rates as ticks progress to subsequent developmental stages"
"Secondly, adult ticks infected via cofeeding tend to reduce the infection rate in their offspring through various mechanisms, including tick mortality caused by rickettsiae, egg hatching failure, and a low transovarial transmission rate"
"Additionally, in natural settings, infections from other pathogens may similarly contribute to tick mortality and reduced egg hatching"
This study elucidates why rickettsiae maintain a low prevalence in nature and evaluates the actual effects of tick-cofeeding on pathogen distribution among ticks

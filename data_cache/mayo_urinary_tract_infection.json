About the size of a football, it's located mainly in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and above your stomach.Hemochromatosis (he-moe-kroe-muh-TOE-sis) is a condition that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food. Excess iron is stored in the organs, especially the liver, heart and pancreas. Too much iron can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as liver disease, heart problems and diabetes.There are a few types of hemochromatosis, but the most common type is caused by a gene change passed down through families. Only a few people who have the genes ever develop serious problems. Symptoms usually appear in midlife.Treatment includes regularly removing blood from the body. Because much of the body's iron is contained in red blood cells, this treatment lowers iron levels.Products & ServicesA Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health BookNewsletter: Mayo Clin", "source": "Mayo Clinic", "url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351446"}, "timestamp": 1745262875.5280967, "ttl": 86400}
